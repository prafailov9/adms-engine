 * 1. Superclass Constructor Execution: If there is a superclass, its constructor is executed first.
 * 2. Instance Variables Initialization and Instance Initializers: Instance variables are initialized in the order they are
 *      declared in the class, and any instance initializers are executed.
 *      This occurs before the constructorâ€™s own code is executed.
 * 3. Constructor Execution: Finally, the constructor of the class itself is executed.
